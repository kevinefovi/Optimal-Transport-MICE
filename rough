Fetch data, standardize it. Prepare MCAR, MAR, MNAR masking functions
Duplicate processed data into 3 datasets, with 30% masks

The pointwise metric used to assess the imputation algorithm is MAE or RMSE
(Outliers cause much larger errors with RMSE than MAE)

The paper proposed 3 methods, 1 non parametric that works well with in-sample. 
Others were parametric and generated strong OOS results. The former is fine for static 
low dimensioonal datasets with missing values. If new rows are appended live, then 
the parametric methods need to be used

For OT-PMM, build both transductive and inductive tools to compare to paper's non parametric
and parametric as benchmarks

Currently the matching of donors to recipients in PMM keeps the distribution of the data alive, however falls apart in higher dimensions + choppy fills if there aren't many donors to recipients 

Tree based approaches to how donors are matched to recipients have been explore, mine can use OT to find the matching. Matching is traditionally done with k nearest neighbours
